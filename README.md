The project was developed using **React** together with **TypeScript**, a combination that makes the website both dynamic and reliable. React allows the interface to be built from reusable components, keeping the structure clean and making navigation smooth without reloading the page. TypeScript complements this by adding type checking, which helps prevent errors and ensures that the data (such as player information or images) is always handled correctly. This way, React provides the interactivity and modern design of the site, while TypeScript guarantees that the code is easier to maintain and more robust.
